# Technical Specification

## Contract Overview

The Bitcoin Investment DAO smart contract implements a decentralized autonomous organization for managing collective Bitcoin investments through the Stacks blockchain.

## Data Structures

### Members

```clarity
(define-map members
    principal
    {
        staked-amount: uint,
        last-reward-block: uint,
        rewards-claimed: uint
    }
)
```

### Proposals

```clarity
(define-map proposals
    uint
    {
        proposer: principal,
        title: (string-ascii 100),
        description: (string-ascii 500),
        amount: uint,
        recipient: principal,
        start-block: uint,
        end-block: uint,
        yes-votes: uint,
        no-votes: uint,
        status: (string-ascii 20),
        executed: bool
    }
)
```

### Votes

```clarity
(define-map votes
    {proposal-id: uint, voter: principal}
    {vote: bool}
)
```

## Core Functions

### Membership Management

#### stake-tokens

- **Purpose**: Allow users to stake tokens and become members
- **Parameters**: `amount: uint`
- **Returns**: `(response bool uint)`
- **Conditions**:
  - Amount must be positive
  - Sufficient token balance

#### unstake-tokens

- **Purpose**: Allow members to withdraw staked tokens
- **Parameters**: `amount: uint`
- **Returns**: `(response bool uint)`
- **Conditions**:
  - Sufficient staked balance
  - No active votes

### Proposal Management

#### create-proposal

- **Purpose**: Create new investment proposal
- **Parameters**:
  - `title: (string-ascii 100)`
  - `description: (string-ascii 500)`
  - `amount: uint`
  - `recipient: principal`
- **Returns**: `(response uint uint)`
- **Conditions**:
  - Proposer has minimum stake
  - Valid parameters

#### vote

- **Purpose**: Cast vote on proposal
- **Parameters**:
  - `proposal-id: uint`
  - `vote-for: bool`
- **Returns**: `(response bool uint)`
- **Conditions**:
  - Active proposal
  - Member hasn't voted
  - Within voting period

#### execute-proposal

- **Purpose**: Execute approved proposal
- **Parameters**: `proposal-id: uint`
- **Returns**: `(response bool uint)`
- **Conditions**:
  - Voting period ended
  - Quorum reached
  - More yes than no votes

## State Transitions

### Proposal States

1. Created -> Active
2. Active -> Executed/Rejected
3. No reverse transitions allowed

### Member States

1. Non-member -> Member (stake)
2. Member -> Non-member (unstake)
3. Member stake increase/decrease

## Security Considerations

### Access Control

- Owner-only functions
- Member-only functions
- Public functions

### Input Validation

- Amount bounds
- String lengths
- Address validation

### State Protection

- Status checks
- Balance verification
- Transition rules

## Error Handling

Detailed error codes with specific meanings:

- u100: Authorization
- u101-u112: Various validation errors

## Performance Considerations

- Efficient data structures
- Minimal state changes
- Optimized loops and calculations
